<h1>About Us</h1>

<p id="bj"> 

Kshitij is the annual techno-management fest of IIT Kharagpur, one of the Indiaâ€™s premier technical institutions. Started in the year 2004, the idea of Kshitij was conceived with the aim to provide the technically inclined youth a national-level platform, where their talent and expertise would be recognized and duly rewarded. Having grown exponentially since its nascent years, Kshitij receives an overwhelming participation from the student community all over the world. The official website of Kshitij, www.ktj.in, is in fact the largest student run website, receiving 8 million clicks in one of its editions.

World renowned organizations like ACM, IEEE, INCOSE, ASHRAE and IMechE certify numerous events of the fest. To address the issues plaguing our present society, Kshitij also undertakes social initiatives in association with the foremost organisations of the country like UNICEF. Workshops are conducted at several locations all over the country, to help the participants gain hand-on experience and enhance their technical skills. Culminating in a three day extravaganza, Kshitij also organizes many inspiring guest lectures, exhibitions and Megashows.
